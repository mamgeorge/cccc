<div class="well "><b>Our Expectations</b><br />
In Matt 11:30, Jesus says, <i>"My yoke is easy and my burden is light."</i>
We see in this we are children of a good master.
Commit yourself to following the lead of the Holy Spirit.
If you fall behind, cheerfully renew your commitment to grow in faithfulness.
Gal 5:18 teaches: "But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the Law."
</div>

<div class="well" ><b>Our Strategy: For those starting out</b><br />
By clicking on the chapter links, you can go directly to the chapter and read it in BibleGateway.
You can easily listen to the Bible by clicking the speaker icon in BibleGateway.
The default version is NIV, which is what our church mainly uses, but you can change this too.
<br /><li /><br />
This plan uses 1 chapter in the morning.
The books used are from either the Psalms, the Proverbs, or the Gospels.
Psalm 119 has 22 paragraphs; we use one for each day because it is large.
This plan repeats Proverbs between the Gospel books.
<br /><li /><br />
( This method ends the morning reading in November.
Because of this, the last reading of Proverbs was added to finish us in December, but it is optional. )
</div>

<div class="well"><b>Our Strategy: For those reading the entire Bible</b><br />
There is an evening reading of about 3 chapters.
Reading the morning & evening plans together covers the entire Bible in a year.
After most books, especially the larger ones, there is a break for 1 day.
This gives the reader to to reflect on the last book read.
